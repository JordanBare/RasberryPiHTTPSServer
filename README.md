# RaspberryPiWebServer
This is a work-in-progress HTTPS Server using Boost.Asio Beast, cereal, OpenSSL, and SQLite. 
It's in need of several more refactors, and the password calls, HTML and CSS are not final. 
Note that I'm self-taught for pretty much everything. 
My longterm goal is to host this server from home on my Pi. 
Learn by doing, as I like to say. SSL-related files are excluded for obvious reasons. 
No, my password to my server will not be "password" on release.
Commit messages look weird because I was working on and committing different parts of the program simultaneously.
Work in a group setting will be more modular.
